# Touch the Current: Bio-Inspired Hydrodynamic and Visual Fusion for Underwater Ego-Motion Estimation

In underwater environments, accurate ego-motion estimation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems. However, traditional methods such as Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) often fail in turbid waters due to poor visibility, while Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) are costly and limited in shallow waters. Inspired by the lateral line system of fish, which can sense fluid dynamics with remarkable sensitivity, our approach utilizes a novel sensor design capable of robustly capturing hydrodynamic flows under various environmental conditions. The proposed system employs an array of passive propellers to visualize water flow patterns, which are then processed using computer vision techniques to extract motion features. These visual cues are combined with inertial data and processed by a CNN-based neural network for precise velocity estimation and trajectory tracking. Experiments conducted in underwater environments show that the system achieves a significant improvement in accuracy, without relying on any external features. This bio-inspired hydrodynamic-visual fusion approach provides a cost-effective and reliable solution for underwater ego-motion estimation, paving the way for the development of advanced underwater robotics and exploration systems.
